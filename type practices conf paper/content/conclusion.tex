\section{Conclusions}

Given that type errors commonly occur in dynamically typed languages such as Python, the misuse of the free typing discipline may produce hidden bugs and reduce software quality. In this paper, we studied six types of risky type-aware practices performed by developers in Python programs. We carried out a study, which consists of quantitative research and qualitative research, to investigate the characteristics and the effects of dynamic type-aware practices in Python systems. The results show that: (1) \emph{Inconsistent Variable Types} is the most common type of dynamic type-aware practices, while \emph{Dynamic Attribute Deletion} rarely occurs in Python systems; (2) dynamic type-aware practices are introduced by developers into Python systems mainly during early development phase; (3) most types of dynamic type-aware practices have a significant positive correlation with bug occurring in Python systems, and more than 52\% of developers have realized it. These findings also imply that: (1) developers follow different type-aware coding conventions; (2) dynamic type-aware practices are useful but dangerous; (3) dynamic type-aware practices can be improved.

Based on this study of dynamic type-aware practices, we suggest that developers should restrict their way of using dynamic typing discipline, and encourage researchers and practitioners to develop effective tools to improve dynamic type-aware practices.
